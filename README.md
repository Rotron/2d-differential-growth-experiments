Series of visual experiments in JavaScript exploring the topic of __differential growth__ as a method for generating interesting 2D forms. I am particularly interested in the applications of such techniques in the context of digital fabrication, therefore these experiments will be more focused on schematic representations (colorless, vector-based, SVG/STL exports) over purely visual effects.
